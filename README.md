# Block 26 React Workshop - Contact List 

In this Workshop I am building an application that allows us to view a list of contacts and gain more details about a selected contact. I will be fetching data from an external API and displaying it in React components.

The contact details will include information such as the contact's name, email, and phone number.

The API I'll be accessing is called JSONPlaceholder, which is a free and open API that provides sample data for testing and learning purposes.

To fetch the contact data, I'll make requests to the /users endpoint of the JSONPlaceholder API. This endpoint will provide me with an array of contacts, each containing properties like name, email, and phone number.

## Workshop Objectives

Throughout this workshop, I'll cover the following objectives:

1. Setting up the React application structure.
2. Fetching data from the JSONPlaceholder API using the fetch() API.
3. Storing the fetched data in the component's state using the useState hook.
4. Rendering a list of contacts and displaying their basic information.
5. Implementing the ability to click on a contact to view their detailed information.
6. Managing state and updating the UI based on user interactions.
7. Exploring best practices for handling asynchronous data fetching in React.
